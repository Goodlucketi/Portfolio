                Hello, I'm Mfoniso Fabian Etim, a passionate and dedicated technology enthusiast from Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Uyo, I have cultivated a deep understanding and proficiency in various web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, React.js, PHP, and Node.js. <br>

                My professional journey has seen me take on roles that hone my skills and broaden my experience in the tech industry. As a Web Instructor at Classic Systems Infotech Limited in Ado Ekiti, I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and inspire budding developers. My role as a Front End Developer at Kinplus Technologies in Ekiti State allowed me to work on innovative projects, pushing the boundaries of web development. <br>

                Driven by a strong belief in the power of technology to transform lives, I founded Meln Hub in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Through this initiative, I aim to create a community where technology enthusiasts can collaborate, learn, and innovate together. <br>

                Beyond my professional endeavors, I have a deep passion for giving back to humanity. I am committed to solving real-world problems through technology and educating others about the vast possibilities available in this field. My hobbies, which include coding, meditating, playing football, gaming, and making friends, keep me balanced and constantly fuel my creativity. <br>

                I believe that technology is a tool for change and empowerment. By leveraging my skills and experience, I strive to make a positive impact on society and help others achieve their purpose.
